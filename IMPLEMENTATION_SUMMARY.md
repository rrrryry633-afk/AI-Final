## 📝 Notes

1. **Signup Button Visibility**: The requirement has been successfully implemented:
   - Client login (`/login`) → Shows "Create one" link
   - Admin login (`/admin/login`) → Does NOT show signup link

2. **Role-Based Redirection**: After login, users are automatically redirected based on their role:
   - Admin → `/admin` dashboard
   - Client → `/client/home` mobile-first interface

3. **Database**: PostgreSQL is properly configured and seeded with test data.

4. **Environment**: All services are running via supervisor with hot reload enabled.
